            <h4>Who are you?</h4>
            <p>I already told you, my name is Juli. Julianne Ong. But to actually answer your question, I am an artist. 
            My primary medium is music, but I love to make video-games and short films / music videos as well. 
            I'd like to get into visual arts such as drawing but... honestly I don't have the patience right now.</p>

            <h4>What kind of music do you make?</h4>
            <p>My favorite type of music to make and listen to is electronic, but not necessarily EDM. 
            Not to say I don't love EDM, I just think that there is so much more to electronic music than people give it credit for. 
            I mix in elements of punk-rock, hip-hop, and sometimes even full orchestral tracks into what I create. Somehow it just feels natural for me.</p>

            <h4>What instruments do you play?</h4>
            <p>Piano and vocals are my main instruments, but I can play electronic/acoustic/bass guitar and the drums as well. 
            Almost all of the instrumentals in the songs I create I play myself, save for collaborative projects and sampled tracks. 
            Oh- also I gig as a DJ on the side. Electronic/pop and hip-hop/r&b sets respectively, just depends on the event.</p>

            <h4>Where can I listen to your music?</h4>
            <p>My music projects are out on pretty much all the major platforms, such as Spotify and Apple Music, but on some small ones as well. Except for Soundcloud. 
            I keep forgetting to update that one, I'll get to it later though. On YouTube you can find all my original music as well as music videos and mashups/remixes.
            Those are always a lot of fun to make.</p>

            <h4>How about your games?</h4>
            <p>At the moment, I don't have any solo video game projects completed, the games I have made have been with different groups and unpublished. I'll keep you updated
                on the progress of future games, though.
            </p>
